# Dynamic Server

The main goal on this project it's to put in practice all my knowledge about NodeJS native modules. Of course, this project won't be entirely ended in a week, once, I'm plan every step, however, the main goal is ready, which is an dynamic server.

## What show I plan?

This project isn't for only access, as we normally do in an web site, however, I wish to manipulate with the FS system through and so on, and this includes:

- Create/Remove directories;
- Create/Remove files;
- Write/Delete data;
- CRUD;

Probably, I'll work with database too, however, this is for future, for now, I'll focus on the main goals.
